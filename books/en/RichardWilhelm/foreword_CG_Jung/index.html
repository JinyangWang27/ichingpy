<h1 id="foreword-by-carl-gustav-jung">Foreword by Carl Gustav Jung<a class="headerlink" href="#foreword-by-carl-gustav-jung" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Since I am not a sinologue, a foreword to the Book of Changes from my hand must be a testimonial of my individual experience with this great and singular book.
It also affords me a welcome opportunity to pay tribute again to the memory of my late friend, Richard Wilhelm.
He himself was profoundly aware of the cultural significance of
his translation of the I Ching, a version unrivaled in the West.</p>
<p>If the meaning of the Book of Changes were easy to grasp, the work would need no foreword.
But this is far from being the case, for there is so much that is obscure
about it that Western scholars have tended to dispose of it as
a collection of ”magic spells„, either too abstruse to be
intelligible, or of no value whatsoever. Legge’s translation
of the I Ching, up to now the only version available in
English, has done little to make the work accessible to
Western minds <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Wilhelm, however, has made every effort
to open the way to an understanding of the symbolism of the
text. He was in a position to do this because he himself was
taught the philosophy and the use of the I Ching by the
venerable sage Lao Nai-hsuan; moreover, he had over a
period of many years put the peculiar technique of the oracle
into practice. His grasp of the living meaning of the text
gives his version of the I Ching a depth of perspective that
an exclusively academic knowledge of Chinese philosophy
could never provide.</p>
<p>I am greatly indebted to Wilhelm for the light he has
thrown upon the complicated problem of the I Ching, and
for insight as regards its practical application as well.
For more than thirty years I have interested myself in this oracle
technique, or method of exploring the unconscious, for it
has seemed to me of uncommon significance. I was already
fairly familiar with the I Ching when I first met Wilhelm in
the early nineteen twenties; he confirmed for me then what I
already knew, and taught me many things more.</p>
<p>I do not know Chinese and have never been in China.
I can assure my reader that it is not altogether easy to find the right access to this monument of Chinese thought,
which departs so completely from our ways of thinking.
In order to understand what such a book is all about, it is imperative to cast off certain prejudices of the Western mind.
It is a curious fact that such a gifted and intelligent people as the Chinese has never developed what we call science.
Our science, however, is based upon the principle of causality, and causality is considered to be an axiomatic truth.
But a great change in our standpoint is setting in.
What Kant’s <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> failed to do, is being accomplished by modern physics.
The axioms of causality are being shaken to their foundations: we know now that what we
term natural laws are merely statistical truths and thus must
necessarily allow for exceptions.
We have not sufficiently taken into account as yet that we need the laboratory with its
incisive restrictions in order to demonstrate the invariable validity of natural law.
If we leave things to nature, we see a very different picture: every process is partially or totally
interfered with by chance, so much so that under natural
circumstances a course of events absolutely conforming to
specific laws is almost an exception.</p>
<p>The Chinese mind, as I see it at work in the I Ching, seems to be exclusively preoccupied with the chance aspect of events.
What we call coincidence seems to be the chief concern of this peculiar mind, and what we worship as causality passes almost unnoticed.
We must admit that there is something to be said for the immense importance of chance.
An incalculable amount of human effort is directed to combating and restricting the nuisance or danger represented by chance.
Theoretical considerations of cause and effect often look pale and dusty in comparison to the practical results of chance.
It is all very well to say that the crystal of quartz is a hexagonal prism.
The statement is quite true in so far as an ideal crystal is envisaged.
But in nature one finds no two crystals exactly alike, although all are unmistakably hexagonal.
The actual form, however, seems to appeal more to the Chinese sage than the ideal one.
The jumble of natural laws constituting empirical reality holds more significance for him than a causal explanation of events that,
moreover, must usually be separated from one another in order to be properly dealt with.</p>
<p>The manner in which the I Ching tends to look upon reality seems to disfavor our causalistic procedures.
The moment under actual observation appears to the ancient Chinese view more of a chance hit than a clearly defined result of concurring causal chain processes.
The matter of interest seems to be the configuration formed by chance events in the moment of observation, and not at all the
hypothetical reasons that seemingly account for the coincidence.
While the Western mind carefully sifts, weighs, selects, classifies, isolates, the Chinese picture of
the moment encompasses everything down to the minutest nonsensical detail, because all of the ingredients make up the observed moment.</p>
<p>Thus it happens that when one throws the three coins, or counts through the forty-nine yarrow stalks,
these chance details enter into the picture of the moment of observation and form a part of it - a part that is insignificant to us, yet most meaningful to the Chinese mind.
With us it would be a banal and almost meaningless statement (at least on the face of it) to say that whatever happens in a given moment
possesses inevitably the quality peculiar to that moment.
This is not an abstract argument but a very practical one.
There are certain connoisseurs who can tell you merely from
the appearance, taste, and behavior of a wine the site of its
vineyard and the year of its origin. There are antiquarians
who with almost uncanny accuracy will name the time and
place of origin and the maker of an <em>objet d’art</em> or piece of
furniture on merely looking at it. And there are even
astrologers who can tell you, without any previous
knowledge of your nativity, what the position of sun and
moon was and what zodiacal sign rose above the horizon in
the moment of your birth. In the face of such facts, it must
be admitted that moments can leave long-lasting traces.</p>
<p>In other words, whoever invented the I Ching was
convinced that the hexagram worked out in a certain
moment coincided with the latter in quality no less than in
time. To him the hexagram was the exponent of the moment
in which it was cast - even more so than the hours of the
clock or the divisions of the calendar could be - inasmuch as
the hexagram was understood to be an indicator of the
essential situation prevailing in the moment of its origin.</p>
<p>This assumption involves a certain curious principle that
I have termed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity">synchronicity</a> <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, a concept that formulates a
point of view diametrically opposed to that of causality.
Since the latter is a merely statistical truth and not absolute,
it is a sort of working hypothesis of how events evolve one
out of another, whereas synchronicity takes the coincidence
of events in space and time as meaning something more than
mere chance, namely, a peculiar interdependence of
objective events among themselves as well as with the
subjective (psychic) states of the observer or observers.</p>
<p>The ancient Chinese mind contemplates the cosmos in a
way comparable to that of the modern physicist, who cannot
deny that his model of the world is a decidedly
psychophysical structure. The microphysical event includes
the observer just as much as the reality underlying the I
Ching comprises subjective, i.e., psychic conditions in the
totality of the momentary situation. Just as causality
describes the sequence of events, so synchronicity to the
Chinese mind deals with the coincidence of events. The
causal point of view tells us a dramatic story about how D
came into existence: it took its origin from C, which existed
before D, and C in its turn had a father, B, etc. The
synchronistic view on the other hand tries to produce an
equally meaningful picture of coincidence. How does it
happen that A’, B’, C’, D’, etc., appear all in the same
moment and in the same place? It happens in the first place
because the physical events A’ and B’ are of the same quality
as the psychic events C’ and D’, and further because all are
the exponents of one and the same momentary situation. The
situation is assumed to represent a legible or understandable
picture.</p>
<p>Now the sixty-four hexagrams of the I Ching are the
instrument by which the meaning of sixty-four different yet
typical situations can be determined. These interpretations
are equivalent to causal explanations. Causal connection is
statistically necessary and can therefore be subjected to
experiment. Inasmuch as situations are unique and cannot be
repeated, experimenting with synchronicity seems to be
impossible under ordinary conditions <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.
In the I Ching, the only criterion of the validity of synchronicity is the
observer’s opinion that the text of the hexagram amounts to
a true rendering of his psychic condition. It is assumed that
the fall of the coins or the result of the division of the bundle
of yarrow stalks is what it necessarily must be in a given
"situation," inasmuch as anything happening in that moment
belongs to it as an indispensable part of the picture. If a
handful of matches is thrown to the floor, they form the
pattern characteristic of that moment. But such an obvious
truth as this reveals its meaningful nature only if it is
possible to read the pattern and to verify its interpretation,
partly by the observer’s knowledge of the subjective and
objective situation, partly by the character of subsequent
events. It is obviously not a procedure that appeals to a
critical mind used to experimental verification of facts or to
factual evidence. But for someone who likes to look at the
world at the angle from which ancient China saw it, the I
Ching may have some attraction.</p>
<p>My argument as outlined above has of course never
entered a Chinese mind. On the contrary, according to the
old tradition, it is "spiritual agencies," acting in a mysterious
way, that make the yarrow stalks give a meaningful answer <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.
These powers form, as it were, the living soul of the book.
As the latter is thus a sort of animated being, the tradition
assumes that one can put questions to the I Ching and expect
to receive intelligent answers. Thus it occurred to me that it
might interest the uninitiated reader to see the I Ching at
work. For this purpose I made an experiment strictly in
accordance with the Chinese conception: I personified the
book in a sense, asking its judgment about its present
situation, i.e., my intention to present it to the Western
mind.</p>
<p>Although this procedure is well within the premises of
Taoist philosophy, it appears exceedingly odd to us.
However, not even the strangeness of insane delusions or of
primitive superstition has ever shocked me. I have always
tried to remain unbiased and curious - <em>rerum novarum
cupidus</em>. Why not venture a dialogue with an ancient book
that purports to be animated? There can be no harm in it,
and the reader may watch a psychological procedure that
has been carried out time and again throughout the millennia
of Chinese civilization, representing to a Confucius or a
Lao-tse both a supreme expression of spiritual authority and
a philosophical enigma. I made use of the coin method, and
the answer obtained was hexagram 50, Ting, THE CALDRON.</p>
<p>In accordance with the way my question was phrased, the
text of the hexagram must be regarded as though the I Ching
itself were the speaking person. Thus it describes itself as a
caldron, that is, as a ritual vessel containing cooked food.
Here the food is to be understood as spiritual nourishment.
Wilhelm says about this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Ting, as a utensil pertaining to a refined
civilization, suggests the fostering and
nourishing of able men, which redounded to the
benefit of the state. . . . Here we see civilization
as it reaches its culmination in religion. The ting
serves in offering sacrifice to God. . . . The
supreme revelation of God appears in prophets
and holy men. To venerate them is true
veneration of God. The will of God, as revealed
through them, should he accepted in humility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keeping to our hypothesis, we must conclude that the I Ching is here testifying concerning itself.
When any of the lines of a given hexagram have the
value of six or nine, it means that they are specially
emphasized and hence important in the interpretation <sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.
In my hexagram the "spiritual agencies" have given the
emphasis of a nine to the lines in the second and in the third
place. The text says:
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Nine in the second place means:
There is food in the Ting.
My comrades are envious,
But they cannot harm me.
Good fortune.
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>Thus the I Ching says of itself: "I contain (spiritual)
nourishment." Since a share in something great always
arouses envy, the chorus of the envious<sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> is part of the picture.
The envious want to rob the I Ching of its great
possession, that is, they seek to rob it of meaning, or to
destroy its meaning. But their enmity is in vain. Its richness
of meaning is assured; that is, it is convinced of its positive
achievements, which no one can take away. The text continues:
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Nine in the third place means:
The handle of the ting is altered.
One is impeded in his way of life.
The fat of the pheasant is not eaten.
Once rain falls, remorse is spent.
Good fortune comes in the end.
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>The handle [German Griff] is the part by which the ting
can be grasped [gegriffen]. Thus it signifies the concept<sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup>
(Begriff) one has of the I Ching (the ting). In the course of
time this concept has apparently changed, so that today we
can no longer grasp (begreifen) the I Ching. Thus "one is
impeded in his way of life." We are no longer supported by
the wise counsel and deep insight of the oracle; therefore we
no longer find our way through the mazes of fate and the
obscurities of our own natures. The fat of the pheasant, that
is, the best and richest part of a good dish, is no longer
eaten. But when the thirsty earth finally receives rain again,
that is, when this state of want has been overcome,
"remorse," that is, sorrow over the loss of wisdom, is ended,
and then comes the longed-for opportunity. Wilhelm
comments: "This describes a man who, in a highly evolved
civilization, finds himself in a place where no one notices or
recognizes him. This is a severe block to his effectiveness."
The I Ching is complaining, as it were, that its excellent
qualities go unrecognized and hence lie fallow. It comforts
itself with the hope that it is about to regain recognition.</p>
<p>The answer given in these two salient lines to the
question I put to the I Ching requires no particular subtlety
of interpretation, no artifices, no unusual knowledge.
Anyone with a little common sense can understand the
meaning of the answer; it is the answer of one who has a
good opinion of himself, but whose value is neither
generally recognized nor even widely known. The
answering subject has an interesting notion of itself: it looks
upon itself as a vessel in which sacrificial offerings are
brought to the gods, ritual food for their nourishment. It
conceives of itself as a cult utensil serving to provide
spiritual nourishment for the unconscious elements or forces
("spiritual agencies") that have been projected as gods - in
other words, to give these forces the attention they need in
order to play their part in the life of the individual. Indeed,
this is the original meaning of the word religio - a careful
observation and taking account of (from relegere<sup id="fnref:8"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8">8</a></sup>) the
numinous.</p>
<p>The method of the I Ching does indeed take into account
the hidden individual quality in things and men, and in one’s
own unconscious self as well. I have questioned the I Ching
as one questions a person whom one is about to introduce to
friends: one asks whether or not it will be agreeable to him.
In answer the I Ching tells me of its religious significance,
of the fact that at present it is unknown and misjudged, of its
hope of being restored to a place of honor - this last
obviously with a sidelong glance at my as yet unwritten
foreword,<sup id="fnref:9"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:9">9</a></sup> and above all at the English translation. This
seems a perfectly understandable reaction, such as one could
expect also from a person in a similar situation.</p>
<p>But how has this reaction come about? Because I threw
three small coins into the air and let them fall, roll, and
come to rest, heads up or tails up as the case might be. This
odd fact that a reaction that makes sense arises out of a
technique seemingly excluding all sense from the outset, is
the great achievement of the I Ching. The instance I have
just given is not unique; meaningful answers are the rule.
Western sinologues and distinguished Chinese scholars have
been at pains to inform me that the I Ching is a collection of
obsolete "magic spells." In the course of these conversations
my informant has sometimes admitted having consulted the
oracle through a fortune teller, usually a Taoist priest. This
could be "only nonsense" of course. But oddly enough, the
answer received apparently coincided with the questioner’s
psychological blind spot remarkably well.</p>
<p>I agree with Western thinking that any number of
answers to my question were possible, and I certainly cannot
assert that another answer would not have been equally
significant. However, the answer received was the first and
only one; we know nothing of other possible answers. It
pleased and satisfied me. To ask the same question a second
time would have been tactless and so I did not do it: "the
master speaks but once." The heavy-handed pedagogic
approach that attempts to fit irrational phenomena into a
preconceived rational pattern is anathema to me. Indeed,
such things as this answer should remain as they were when
they first emerged to view, for only then do we know what
nature does when left to herself undisturbed by the
meddlesomeness of man. One ought not to go to cadavers to
study life. Moreover, a repetition of the experiment is
impossible, for the simple reason that the original situation
cannot be reconstructed. Therefore in each instance there is
only a first and single answer.</p>
<p>To return to the hexagram itself. There is nothing strange
in the fact that all of Ting, THE CALDRON, amplifies the
themes announced by the two salient lines.<sup id="fnref:10"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10">10</a></sup> The first line of
the hexagram says:
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>A ting with legs upturned.
Furthers removal of stagnating stuff.
One takes a concubine
for the sake of her son.
No blame.
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>A ting that is turned upside down is not in use. Hence the
I Ching is like an unused caldron. Turning it over serves to
remove stagnating matter, as the line says. Just as a man
takes a concubine when his wife has no son, so the I Ching
is called upon when one sees no other way out. Despite the
quasi-legal status of the concubine in China, she is in reality
only a somewhat awkward makeshift so likewise the magic
procedure of the oracle is an expedient that may be utilized
for a higher purpose. There is no blame, although it is an
exceptional recourse.</p>
<p>The second and third lines have already been discussed.
The fourth line says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The legs of the ting are broken.
The prince’s meal is spilled
And his person is soiled.
Misfortune.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the ting has been put to use, but evidently in a very
clumsy manner, that is, the oracle has been abused or
misinterpreted. In this way the divine food is lost, and one
puts oneself to shame. Legge translates as follows: "Its
subject will be made to blush for shame." Abuse of a cult
utensil such as the ting (i.e., the I Ching) is a gross
profanation. The I Ching is evidently insisting here on its
dignity as a ritual vessel and protesting against being
profanely used.</p>
<p>The fifth line says:
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>The ting has yellow handles,
golden carrying rings.
Perseverance furthers.
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>The I Ching has, it seems, met with a new, correct
(yellow) understanding, that is, a new concept (Begriff) by
which it can be grasped. This concept is valuable (golden).
There is indeed a new edition in English, making the book
more accessible to the Western world than before.</p>
<p>The sixth line says:
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>The ting has rings of jade.
Great good fortune.
Nothing that would not act to further.
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>Jade is distinguished for its beauty and soft sheen. If the
carrying rings are of jade, the whole vessel is enhanced in
beauty, honor, and value. The I Ching expresses itself here
as being not only well satisfied but indeed very optimistic.
One can only await further events and in the meantime
remain content with the pleasant conclusion that the I Ching
approves of the new edition.</p>
<p>I have shown in this example as objectively as I can how
the oracle proceeds in a given case. Of course the procedure
varies somewhat according to the way the question is put. If
for instance a person finds himself in a confusing situation,
he may himself appear in the oracle as the speaker. Or, if the
question concerns a relationship with another person, that
person may appear as the speaker. However, the identity of
the speaker does not depend entirely on the manner in which
the question is phrased, inasmuch as our relations with our
fellow beings are not always determined by the latter. Very
often our relations depend almost exclusively on our own
attitudes, though we maybe quite unaware of this fact.
Hence, if an individual is unconscious of his role in a
relationship, there may be a surprise in store for him;
contrary to expectation, he himself may appear as the chief
agent, as is sometimes unmistakably indicated by the text. It
may also occur that we take a situation too seriously and
consider it extremely important, whereas the answer we get
on consulting the I Ching draws attention to some
unsuspected other aspect implicit in the question.</p>
<p>Such instances might at first lead one to think that the
oracle is fallacious. Confucius is said to have received only
one inappropriate answer, i.e., hexagram 22, GRACE - a
thoroughly aesthetic hexagram. This is reminiscent of the
advice given to Socrates by his daemon - "You ought to
make more music" - whereupon Socrates took to playing the
flute. Confucius and Socrates compete for first place as far
as reasonableness and a pedagogic attitude to life are
concerned; but it is unlikely that either of them occupied
himself with "lending grace to the beard on his chin," as the
second line of this hexagram advises. Unfortunately, reason
and pedagogy often lack charm and grace, and so the oracle
may not have been wrong after all.</p>
<p>To come back once more to our hexagram. Though the I
Ching not only seems to be satisfied with its new edition,
but even expresses emphatic optimism, this still does not
foretell anything about the effect it will have on the public it
is intended to reach. Since we have in our hexagram two
yang lines stressed by the numerical value nine, we are in a
position to find out what sort of prognosis the I Ching
makes for itself. Lines designated by a six or a nine have,
according to the ancient conception, an inner tension so
great as to cause them to change into their opposites, that is,
yang into yin, and vice versa. Through this change we
obtain in the present instance hexagram 55, Chin,
PROGRESS.</p>
<p>The subject of this hexagram is someone who meets with
all sorts of vicissitudes of fortune in his climb upward, and
the text describes how he should behave. The I Ching is in
this same situation: it rises like the sun and declares itself,
but it is rebuffed and finds no confidence - it is
"progressing, but in sorrow." However, "one obtains great
happiness from one’s ancestress." Psychology can help us to
elucidate this obscure passage. In dreams and fairy tales the
grandmother, or ancestress, often represents the unconscious,
because the latter in a man contains the feminine
component of the psyche. If the I Ching is not accepted by
the conscious, at least the unconscious meets it halfway, and
the I Ching is more closely connected with the unconscious
than with the rational attitude of consciousness. Since the
unconscious is often represented in dreams by a feminine
figure, this may be the explanation here. The feminine
person might be the translator, who has given the book her
maternal care, and this might easily appear to the I Ching as
a "great happiness." It anticipates general understanding, but
is afraid of misuse - "Progress like a hamster." But it is
mindful of the admonition, "Take not gain and loss to
heart." It remains free of "partisan motives." It does not
thrust itself on anyone.</p>
<p>The I Ching therefore faces its future on the American
book market calmly and expresses itself here just about as
any reasonable person would in regard to the fate of so
controversial a work. This prediction is so very reasonable
and full of common sense that it would be hard to think of a
more fitting answer.</p>
<p>All of this happened before I had written the foregoing
paragraphs. When I reached this point, I wished to know the
attitude of the I Ching to the new situation. The state of
things had been altered by what I had written, inasmuch as I
myself had now entered upon the scene, and I therefore
expected to hear something referring to my own action. I
must confess that I had not been feeling too happy in the
course of writing this foreword, for, as a person with a sense
of responsibility toward science, I am not in the habit of
asserting something I cannot prove or at least present as
acceptable to reason. It is a dubious task indeed to try to
introduce to a critical modern public a collection of archaic
"magic spells," with the idea of making them more or less
acceptable. I have undertaken it because I myself think that
there is more to the ancient Chinese way of thinking than
meets the eye. But it is embarrassing to me that I must
appeal to the good will and imagination of the reader,
inasmuch as I have to take him into the obscurity of an age-old
magic ritual. Unfortunately I am only too well aware of
the arguments that can be brought against it. We are not
even certain that the ship that is to carry us over the
unknown seas has not sprung a leak somewhere. May not
the old text be corrupt? Is Wilhelm’s translation accurate?
Are we not self-deluded in our explanations?</p>
<p>The I Ching insists upon self-knowledge throughout. The
method by which this is to be achieved is open to every kind
of misuse, and is therefore not for the frivolous-minded and
immature; nor is it for intellectualists and rationalists. It is
appropriate only for thoughtful and reflective people who
like to think about what they do and what happens to them -
a predilection not to be confused with the morbid brooding
of the hypochondriac. As I have indicated above, I have no
answer to the multitude of problems that arise when we seek
to harmonize the oracle of the I Ching with our accepted
scientific canons. But needless to say, nothing "occult" is to
be inferred. My position in these matters is pragmatic, and
the great disciplines that have taught me the practical
usefulness of this viewpoint are psychotherapy and medical
psychology. Probably in no other field do we have to reckon
with so many unknown quantities, and nowhere else do we
become more accustomed to adopting methods that work
even though for a long time we may not know why they
work. Unexpected cures may arise from questionable therapies
and unexpected failures from allegedly reliable
methods. In the exploration of the unconscious we come
upon very strange things, from which a rationalist turns
away with horror, claiming afterward that he did not see
anything. The irrational fullness of life has taught me never
to discard anything, even when it goes against all our
theories (so short-lived at best) or otherwise admits of no
immediate explanation. It is of course disquieting, and one
is not certain whether the compass is pointing true or not;
but security, certitude, and peace do not lead to discoveries.
It is the same with this Chinese mode of divination. Clearly
the method aims at self-knowledge, though at all times it has
also been put to superstitious use.</p>
<p>I of course am thoroughly convinced of the value of self-knowledge,
but is there any use in recommending such
insight, when the wisest of men throughout the ages have
preached the need of it without success? Even to the most
biased eye it is obvious that this book represents one long
admonition to careful scrutiny of one’s own character,
attitude, and motives. This attitude appeals to me and has
induced me to undertake the foreword. Only once before
have I expressed myself in regard to the problem of the I
Ching: this was in a memorial address in tribute to Richard
Willielm.<sup id="fnref:11"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:11">11</a></sup> For the rest I have maintained a discreet silence.
It is by no means easy to feel one’s way into such a remote
and mysterious mentality as that underlying the I Ching.
One cannot easily disregard such great minds as Confucius
and Lao-tse, if one is at all able to appreciate the quality of
the thoughts they represent; much less can one overlook the
fact that the I Ching was their main source of inspiration. I
know that previously I would not have dared to express
myself so explicitly about so uncertain a matter. I can take
this risk because I am now in my eighth decade, and the
changing opinions of men scarcely impress me any more;
the thoughts of the old masters are of greater value to me
than the philosophical prejudices of the Western mind.</p>
<p>I do not like to burden my reader with these personal
considerations; but, as already indicated, one’s own
personality is very often implicated in the answer of the
oracle. Indeed, in formulating my question I even invited the
oracle to comment directly on my action. The answer was
hexagram 29, K’an, THE ABYSMAL. Special emphasis is
given to the third place by the fact that the line is designated
by a six. This line says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Forward and backward, abyss on abyss.
In danger like this, pause at first and wait,
Otherwise you will fall into a pit in the abyss.
Do not act in this way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Formerly I would have accepted unconditionally the
advice, "Do not act in this way," and would have refused to
give my opinion of the I Ching, for the sole reason that I had
none. But now the counsel may serve as an example of the
way in which the I Ching functions. It is a fact that if one
begins to think about it, the problems of the I Ching do
represent "abyss on abyss," and unavoidably one must
"pause at first and wait" in the midst of the dangers of
limitless and uncritical speculation; otherwise one really
will lose his way in the darkness. Could there be a more
uncomfortable position intellectually than that of floating in
the thin air of unproved possibilities, not knowing whether
what one sees is truth or illusion? This is the dreamlike
atmosphere of the I Ching, and in it one has nothing to rely
upon except one’s own so fallible subjective judgment. I
cannot but admit that this line represents very appropriately
the feelings with which I wrote the foregoing passages.
Equally fitting is the comforting beginning of this hexagram - "If you are sincere, you have success in your heart" - for it
indicates that the decisive thing here is not the outer danger
but the subjective condition, that is, whether one believes
oneself to be "sincere" or not.</p>
<p>The hexagram compares the dynamic action in this
situation to the behavior of flowing water, which is not
afraid of any dangerous place but plunges over cliffs and
fills up the pits that lie in its course (K’an also stands for
water). This is the way in which the "superior man" acts and
"carries on the business of teaching."</p>
<p>K’an is definitely one of the less agreeable hexagrams. It
describes a situation in which the subject seems in grave
danger of being caught in all sorts of pitfalls. Just as in
interpreting a dream one must follow the dream text with
utmost exactitude, so in consulting the oracle one must hold
in mind the form of the question put, for this sets a definite
limit to the interpretation of the answer. The first line of the
hexagram notes the presence of the danger: "In the abyss
one falls into a pit." The second line does the same, then
adds the counsel: "One should strive to attain small things
only." I apparently anticipated this advice by limiting myself
in this foreword to a demonstration of how the I Ching
functions in the Chinese mind, and by renouncing the more
ambitious project of writing a psychological commentary on
the whole book.
The fourth line says:
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>A jug of wine, a bowl of rice with it;
Earthen vessels
Simply handed in through the window.
There is certainly no blame in this.
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>Wilhelm makes the following comment here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although as a rule it is customary for an official
to present certain introductory gifts and recommendations
before he is appointed, here everything
is simplified to the utmost. The gifts are
insignificant, there is no one to sponsor him, he
introduces himself; yet all this need not be
humiliating if only there is the honest intention of
mutual help in danger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It looks as if the book were to some degree the subject of
this line.</p>
<p>The fifth line continues the theme of limitation. If one
studies the nature of water, one sees that it fills a pit only to
the rim and then flows on. It does not stay caught there:
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>The abyss is not filled to overflowing,
It is filled only to the rim.
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>But if, tempted by the danger, and just because of the
uncertainty, one were to insist on forcing conviction by
special efforts, such as elaborate commentaries and the like,
one would only be mired in the difficulty, which the top line
describes very accurately as a tied-up and caged-in
condition. Indeed, the last line often shows the consequences
that result when one does not take the meaning of
the hexagram to heart.</p>
<p>In our hexagram we have a six in the third place. This yin
line of mounting tension changes into a yang line and thus
produces a new hexagram showing a new possibility or
tendency. We now have hexagram 48, Ching, THE WELL.
The water hole no longer means danger, however, but rather
something beneficial, a well:
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Thus the superior man encourages
the people at their work,
And exhorts them to help one another.
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>The image of people helping one another would seem to
refer to the reconstruction of the well, for it is broken down
and full of mud. Not even animals drink from it. There are
fishes living in it, and one can shoot these, but the well is
not used for drinking, that is, for human needs. This
description is reminiscent of the overturned and unused ting
that is to receive a new handle. Moreover, this well, like the
ting, is cleaned. But no one drinks from it:
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>This is my heart’s sorrow,
For one might draw from it.
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>The dangerous water hole or abyss pointed to the I
Ching, and so does the well, but the latter has a positive
meaning: it contains the waters of life. It should he restored
to use. But one has no concept (Begriff) of it, no utensil with
which to carry the water; the jug is broken and leaks. The
ting needs new handles and carrying rings by which to grasp
it, and so also the well must be newly lined, for it contains
"a clear, cold spring from which one can drink." One may
draw water from it, because "it is dependable."</p>
<p>It is clear that in this prognosis the speaking subject is
again the I Ching, representing itself as a spring of living
water. The preceding hexagram described in detail the
danger confronting the person who accidentally falls into the
pit within the abyss. He must work his way out of it, in
order to discover that it is an old, ruined well, buried in
mud, but capable of being restored to use again.</p>
<p>I submitted two questions to the method of chance
represented by the coin oracle, the second question being
put after I had written my analysis of the answer to the first.
The first question was directed, as it were, to the I Ching:
what had it to say about my intention to write a foreword?
The second question concerned my own action, or rather the
situation in which I was the acting subject who had
discussed the first hexagram. To the first question the I
Ching replied by comparing itself to a caldron, a ritual
vessel in need of renovation, a vessel that was finding only
doubtful favor with the public. To the second question the
reply was that I had fallen into a difficulty, for the I Ching
represented a deep and dangerous water hole in which one
might easily be mired. However, the water hole proved to be
an old well that needed only to be renovated in order to be
put to useful purposes once more.</p>
<p>These four hexagrams are in the main consistent as
regards theme (vessel, pit, well); and as regards intellectual
content they seem to be meaningful. Had a human being
made such replies, I should, as a psychiatrist, have had to
pronounce him of sound mind, at least on the basis of the
material presented. Indeed, I should not have been able to
discover anything delirious, idiotic, or schizophrenic in the
four answers. In view of the I Ching’s extreme age and its
Chinese origin, I cannot consider its archaic, symbolic, and
flowery language abnormal. On the contrary, I should have
had to congratulate this hypothetical person on the extent of
his insight into my unexpressed state of doubt. On the other
hand, any person of clever and versatile mind can turn the
whole thing around and show how I have projected my
subjective contents into the symbolism of the hexagrams.
Such a critique, though catastrophic from the standpoint of
Western rationality, does no harm to the function of the I
Ching. On the contrary, the Chinese sage would smilingly
tell me: "Don’t you see how useful the I Ching is in making
you project your hitherto unrealized thoughts into its
abstruse symbolism? You could have written your foreword
without ever realizing what an avalanche of misunderstanding
might be released by it."</p>
<p>The Chinese standpoint does not concern itself as to the
attitude one takes toward the performance of the oracle. It is
only we who are puzzled, because we trip time and again
over our prejudice, viz., the notion of causality. The ancient
wisdom of the East lays stress upon the fact that the
intelligent individual realizes his own thoughts, but not in
the least upon the way in which he does it. The less one
thinks about the theory of the I Ching, the more soundly one
sleeps.</p>
<p>It would seem to me that on the basis of this example an
unprejudiced reader would now be in a position to form at
least a tentative judgment on the operation of the I Ching.<sup id="fnref:12"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:12">12</a></sup>
More cannot be expected from a simple introduction. If by
means of this demonstration I have succeeded in elucidating
the psychological phenomenology of the I Ching, I shall
have carried out my purpose. As to the thousands of
questions, doubts, and criticisms that this singular book stirs
up - I cannot answer these. The I Ching does not offer itself
with proofs and results; it does not vaunt itself, nor is it easy
to approach. Like a part of nature, it waits until it is
discovered. It offers neither facts nor power, but for lovers
of self-knowledge, of wisdom - if there be such - it seems to
be the right book. To one person its spirit appears as clear as
day; to another, shadowy as twilight; to a third, dark as
night. He who is not pleased by it does not have to use it,
and he who is against it is not obliged to find it true. Let it
go forth into the world for the benefit of those who can
discern its meaning.</p>

<p>Legge makes the following comment on the explanatory text for the
individual lines: "According to our notions, a framer of emblems should
be a good deal of a poet, but those of Yi only make us think of a
dryasdust. Out of more than three hundred and fifty, the greater numbers
are only grotesque" (The Sacred Books of the East, XVl: The Yi King,
2nd edn., Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1899, p.22). Of the "lessons"’ of the
hexagrams, the same author says: "But why, it may be asked, why
should they be conveyed to us by such an array of lineal figures, and in
such a farrago of emblematic representations" (ibid., p. 25). However,
we are nowhere told that Legge ever bothered to put the method to a
practical test.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
